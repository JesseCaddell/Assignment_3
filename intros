So we are writing a story? How about a bit about ourselves. What are some of your hobbies or likes?

Jesse:
I'm an anime/manga guy... plain and simple. Two favorites are Tokyo Ghoul and Neon Genesis Evangelion.
I love live music. I've seen King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard  4 times and Mewithoutyou 7 times!
