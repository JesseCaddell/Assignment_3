Assignment 3 

Group Project:
In this assignment, students will work in groups on a project in order to practice specific Git skills.

Start a Repo:
Start a repo (repository) and add all members as collaborators. Once this is done, members will take turns making small additions or corrections to a story on branches and making pull requests to be processed by the next team member.

Project Type:
For this project, we'll work on something that is relatively easy, because we want to practice branching, merging, and pull requests. This will level the playing field and allow everyone to gain experience. Use the class hello-world we are developing for the purpose of practicing code management.  

Order of operations for each team member:
The general order of operations looks like this â€”

Create a named branch, and make a change/addition to the site.
Create a pull request to indicate you'd like a second pair of eyes to view/edit your addition.
The second person changes/approves the change and merges the change.
The second person then starts a new branch and begins the process again, passing to the next person on the team.
Determine an initial order for the first couple of merges:
We want everyone involved here, so determine an order for your team, and maintain it for the first couple of merges. If someone is non-responsive for a 24-hour period, feel free to pass on to the next person on your team.
