Assignment 3 

So we are writing a story? How about a bit about ourselves. What are some of your hobbies or likes?

Jesse:
I'm an anime/manga guy... plain and simple. Two favorites are Tokyo Ghoul and Neon Genesis Evangelion.
I love live music. I've seen King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard  4 times and Mewithoutyou 7 times!

Nick:
I prefer manga to anime. I also read comics, love Tarkovsky, and play/write music. Music is my obsession.
I play video games a couple days a month and just ate a burger.

Sarah:
I spend most of my free time getting out to explore with Bulldogs. I also love live music, watching astronomical events,
and road trips that last for weeks. Or months. Those are my favorite.

James: I do enjoy me some anime for sure, currnetly watching some Baki right now . I love to snowboard in the winter.

Eamon: My main hobby is dungeons and dragons, along with most kinds of roleplaying or group storytelling games, I also have a passion for cooking and sci-fi/horror movies.
I only really like a few animes, most of it doesn't really do much for me.
